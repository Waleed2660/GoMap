Creating a Go application that takes a list of destinations from a user and builds a route using the Google Maps API involves several steps.

										Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. Obtain a Google Maps API key: To use the Google Maps API, you need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console. 
	Follow the documentation provided by Google to create a project, enable the Google Maps JavaScript API, and generate an API key.

2. Set up a Go project: Create a new Go project and set up your Go environment. You can use a Go package manager like go mod to manage 
	dependencies and package your application.

3. Import the necessary Go libraries: Import the necessary Go libraries in your project to interact with the Google Maps API. 
	You can use a library like google maps or go-maps to interact with the Google Maps API using Go. These libraries provide functions
	and structs to communicate with the Google Maps API and handle responses.

4. Implement the logic for taking user input: Create a user interface in your Go application to allow users to input a list of destinations. 
	This could be a web form, a command-line interface, or any other appropriate method based on the type of application you're building. 
	Collect the user input and pass it to the Google Maps API for routing.

5. Make requests to the Google Maps API: Use the Google Maps API key obtained earlier to authenticate and authorize your requests. 
	Use the functions provided by the Go libraries to make requests to the Google Maps API with the user's input, such as origin, 
	destination, and mode of transportation.

6. Process the API response: Handle the response from the Google Maps API in your Go application. Parse the response to extract the relevant 
	information, such as the route details, distance, duration, etc.

7. Build the route: Based on the response from the Google Maps API, build the route using the waypoints provided by the user. 
	You can use the routing information to display the route on a map, generate directions, or perform other actions as needed.

8. Display the results: Finally, display the results to the user in an appropriate format, such as a map view, list of directions, 
	or any other desired output.

9. Handle errors: Don't forget to handle errors that may occur during the process, such as API errors, network errors, 
	or user input validation errors. Make sure to provide appropriate error messages and handle exceptions gracefully in your Go application.



This is a high-level overview of how you can create a Go application that takes a list of destinations from a user and builds a route 
using the Google Maps API. The actual implementation details may vary depending on the specific requirements of your application, 
the Go libraries you choose to use, and the user interface you create. Make sure to refer to the documentation of the Google Maps API 
and the Go libraries you use for more detailed implementation guidance.
